                    Aristotle was born in 384 BC in Thessaloniki. Nicomachus was his father, and he was the king of Macedonia’s doctor.
                     Unfortunately, both his parents died when he was young. Aristotle learned many subjects such as biology and philosophy 
                     at a young age.

                     Aristotle is among the greatest philosophers of all time. His writings were very influential from antiquity to today. He has 
                     written in many disciplines (logic, metaphysics philosophy, and much more). Also, He was the teacher of the great Alexander.

                    Aristotle was very good at Metaphysics. He used to call metaphysics the “first philosophy,” or “wisdom.” His primary area of 
                    focus was “being qua being,” which examined what can be said about being based on what it is, not because of any qualities it may have. (History.com).
